# Course Description

**Section Description**: What is AI (artificial intelligence)? An increasing number of software services that support algorithmic decision-making are purportedly powered by AI. Unfortunately, the buzz about AI evokes ideas from science-fiction about autonomous agents gaining free will and achieving consciousness, without any substantive discussion of what AI is and the problems it tries to solve.

**Section Expectations**: In this course, we start from the proposition that AI is the study of possibly sub-optimal, algorithmic solutions to NP-Hard problems. This course will cover the fundamentals of AI via probabilistic models, logic, and search. We will connect AI as algorithmic decision-making to machine learning (ML) as data-driven decision-making and discuss the promise and pitfalls of building decision-making pipelines from these technologies.

**Evaluation**: We will cover background in probability theory, logic, and induction early in the course. Students will choose their own [evaluation](syllabus.html#grading-system), which will be a combination of in-class quizzes, theory assignments, programming assignments, and exams.



### What this course is. 

This course aproaches the field of artificial intelligence from the perspective of computer science. We treat the field of AI as a collection of techniques used to solve a particular class of problems (known as NP-Hard problems in the computing literature). These solutions may not be optimal, but they are typically good enough to deploy in the "real world."


### What this course is not.

This is not a course in [philsophy](https://www.uvm.edu/courses/phil_111), [psychology](https://www.uvm.edu/courses/psys_111), [cognitive science](https://www.uvm.edu/courses/psys_312), [machine learning](https://catalogue.uvm.edu/undergraduate/courses/courselist/cs/), or [deep learning](https://catalogue.uvm.edu/graduate/computerscience/#courseinventory). We will not be discussing the nature of intelligence, free will, the singularity, or whatever cybernetics is; there are many other courses available at UVM that will address these topics!

### Is this course right for me?

Only your own heart + time can tell!

If however, you are concerned about the background required for this course, please see the [schedule](schedule.html) and peruse the [evaluation methods](syllabus.html#grading-system).
